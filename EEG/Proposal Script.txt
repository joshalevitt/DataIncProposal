EEG is an essential medical tool used diagnose a variety of neurological
conditions, like epilepsy. However, our understanding of this tool
remains limited, due to some of the challenges inherent to studying it.
The Temple University Hospital EEG dataset provides a great opportunity
for us to learn more, and to build useful tools for researchers and
clinicians alike.  For example, using this data, we could build
algorithms that could detect important EEG events, like seizures. In
order to test the feasibility of this idea, I trained and tested a
program using 80,000 labeled EEG events. With this approach, the
computer was able to distinguish between seizures, artifacts, background
noise, and other types of events. With greater work, it may be possible
to use similar techniques to diagnose diseases or find patterns not
obvious to doctors.
