REASON FOR STUDY:  Due to seizures.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 83-year-old man with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma and anoxia, found to have a large olfactory groove angioma, status post resection, noted to have seizures.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some intermittent electrode artifact.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.  Overall the background consists of mainly delta 2-4 Hz frequency slow waves that are maximal frontally but seen diffusely throughout the recording.  At times the patient appears to move and there is increasing muscle artifact throughout the recording.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  
* Focal sharp waves seen independently over F4 much more than F3, and at times, especially over the right hemisphere, they appear to have a pseudo periodic pattern and they are recorded throughout the recording.  
* Focal slowing seen independently over the F4 and F3 region at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-50 microvolts, also continuously throughout the recording.

SEIZURES:  None.

HEART RATE:  72.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to bilateral frontal sharp waves and slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures possibly arising from either frontal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal structural dysfunction and irritability in the bilateral frontal lobes, which is consistent with the known history of tumor resection and hemorrhage.  No seizures were seen.
