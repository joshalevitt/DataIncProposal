# DataIncProposal
Some files related to My Data Incubator project proposal

Please see EEG_CNN.pdf for a more comprehensive overview of this project.

The only stuff in here for now are a small portion of my data files, MatLab and python scripts, some figure files, and this README, and my proposal. 

The MatLab script has some dependencies, notably edfRead (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/31900-edfread) and the text analytics toolbox for MatLab, as well as MNE, TensorFlow, NumPy, and SciPy for Python. There is currently a Matlab Nearest-Neighbor Model, and a CNN model in Python. These nodels are seperate and not dependent.

You may also need to edit the directory paths in the script in order for it to work on your setup.
