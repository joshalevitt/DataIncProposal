# DataIncProposal
Some files related to My Data Incubator project proposal

The only stuff in here for now are a small portion of my data files, a MatLab script, some figure files, and this README, and my proposal. 

The MatLab script has some dependencies, notably edfRead (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/31900-edfread) and the text analytics toolbox.

You may also need to edit the directory paths in the script in order for it to work on your setup.
